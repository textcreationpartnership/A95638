            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Lord Admiral Vantrump is come into the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118422:4"/>Downs; where the Dutch maintained a very ſharp diſpute for many hours together; and great was the loſs on both ſides: Many gallant ſhips being ſunk and fired; But by reaſon of the great might and power of the Enemy; their number far exceeding ours; it was thought moſt requiſite to decline, and tack about for Dover Cliff; which we did, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little loſs: So that now we are ſecure, and under the protection of the Caſtle; but expect every hour another engagement; which is a thing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſired both by the Sea-men and ſouldiers; onely it is waved for the preſent, by reaſon that Vice-Admiral Pen is every minute expected with a Squadron of ſhips for our aſſiſtance, which will then compleat us 30 Sayl, gallantly man'd, and well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
               <p>Vantrump lies three leagues diſtance; and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved forthwith to ingage Us; as captain Vand-Erſt informs Us, who hath deſerted them, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Parliament.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe bringeth intelligence, That the States have given Orders for the re-inforcing their Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Towns and Caſtles; and have declared to the People, That our Admiral intends to land ſome ſouldiers about the Brill, and Fluſhing, with a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to cut down the Dammes, or Sea-walls, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118422:4"/>ſo drown the Countrey. The allarum whereof hath ſo exaſperated the ſpirits of many, that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly inraged, and vowes revenge.</p>
               <p>We hear that there is a general Riſing from 16 to 60; and thoſe that do refuſe to to engage, are to die without mercy. They are ſetting forth another great Fleet of 200 ſail, and the Zealanders have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a new Admiral. In our laſt engagement, our loſs is eſteemed killed and wounded about 300. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies far greater.</p>
               <p>There is dayly Action between our Scouts, and Trumps; and this morning captain Peacock, with the Tyger, going to relieve the Guard, was ſet upon by three Dutch-men, who maintained a gallant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, for the ſpace of half an hour; which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral hearing of, diſpatched captain Watſon and captain Taylor to his aſſiſtance, who bearing up cloſe to them, ſaluted them with ſeveral broad ſides, inſomuch that one immediatly ſunk by their ſides; the other two got off, but much batter'd and torn, as well as ours; ſome having their legs and armes ſhot off; others lamentably ſhot and mangled. We hear that General Blake hath a deſign to block up the Zound, which will greatly fruſtrate &amp; eclipſe their liberty, &amp;c.</p>
